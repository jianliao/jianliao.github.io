00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Spectrum 2 is designed for everyone.

00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:06.466
Accessibility isn't an afterthought.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.200
It's built into every part of our system.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.700
To reach this goal at scale.

00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:18.966
We now use AI to automate the process
of making images accessible.

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:23.966
By combining design principles
with intelligent automation.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.100
Spectrum 2 brings inclusivity

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.133
to live across every documentation page.

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:34.100
Every documentation page starts in Figma,

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:38.600
with designers
exporting hero images and other visuals

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
use across Spectrum 2.

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:44.733
But there are hundreds of images
to manage,

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:47.666
and each update to the design system means

00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.666
exporting them again and again.

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:53.566
This is where automation helps.

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.833
Instead of writing
or updating ALT text manually.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.633
AI now generates
it instantly as images change.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.866
Keeping accessibility consistent

00:01:04.866 --> 00:01:07.866
and effortless.

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.600
The CMS Asset

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.833
Manager uploads
new or updated images through GitHub

00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:14.766
pull request.

00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.100
Each image

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.566
is checked into a structured folder
based on this category.

00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:25.800
Once the changes are merged,
a webhook event is triggered

00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:29.000
in the back end, automatically sending

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
these images to GPT-4o,

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:35.333
a multimodal AI model that generates

00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:38.333
professional, context aware captions.

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:42.066
What used to take hours of manual work

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:45.066
now happens instantly and consistently.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.600
Once GPT-4o finishes

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.266
generating a caption,
the webhook automatically uploads

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:57.300
the image and its metadata
back to the CMS.

00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:01.666
Each caption becomes
part of the images record,

00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:04.933
ready to be used in page rendering

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:08.100
When authors preview
the documentation site,

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:13.100
every image already
includes its AI generated ALT text.

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:19.200
The result is a fully accessible
experience that meets the strictest

00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:22.233
WCAG

00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:26.466
2.1 standards
without any extra manual work.

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:29.166
This workflow

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:33.466
brings everything together
from design to automation.

00:02:34.466 --> 00:02:37.666
GitHub acts as the single source of truth.

00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:41.800
Versioning and organizing all image assets

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:45.600
with AI captioning built in.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.200
This approach can easily scale across
multiple languages and documentation

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.866
sites, making accessibility an integral
part of Spectrum 2 by design.
