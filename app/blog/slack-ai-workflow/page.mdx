## Introduction

Adobe Designers rely on icons every day, but finding the right icon at Adobe hasn’t always been easy. With more than 20,000+ icons spread across 70+ Figma files, manually searching for the right asset can slow designers down significantly.

Meanwhile, the Icon/Brand team often spends a huge amount of time in Slack repeatedly helping others locate icons and product logos — time that could be better spent designing and evolving the system.

To solve this, we brought AI-powered icon discovery directly into Slack, where designers already collaborate. This blog introduces the three new workflows now available inside Slack, along with a high-level data-flow diagram that powers the experience.

## Overview of the three AI workflows

We introduced three complementary workflows to help designers find icons in the way that feels most natural:

- Find icon by text — describe what you need using natural language

- Find icon by image — upload a screenshot to search visually

- Ask a question — ask general icon usage questions powered by Agentic reasoning

## Workflow demo: Find icon by text

The first workflow lets you describe an icon using semantics, visual cues, or both.

  title="Find Icon by Text Workflow Demo"
/>

### How it works

- Click Find icon by text in Slack.
- Fill in “Icon represents” and/or “Icon shows.”
- AI searches thousands of icons and returns the top matches.
- Each result includes a preview and a deep link to Figma.

## Workflow demo: Find icon by image

The second workflow lets you search for icons using a screenshot.

  poster="/images/slack-ai-workflow/find-icon-by-image.png"
  title="Find Icon by Image Workflow Demo"
/>

### How it works

- Upload a screenshot (drag-and-drop, paste, or file picker).
- AI compares your image to the icon library and returns the top matches.
- Each result deep-links to the exact icon in Figma.

## Workflow demo: Ask a question

Some questions are about usage, sizing, or guidelines—not a specific icon.
This workflow uses AI to answer natural-language icon questions.

  title="Ask a Question Workflow Demo"
/>

### How it works

- Ask any icon-related question in the dialog.
- Optionally include context to help the assistant interpret intent.
- AI performs multi-step reasoning and returns a consolidated answer.
- If relevant, the assistant automatically performs an icon lookup as well.
- Responses include reference links for deeper reading.

## The AI data flow behind the scenes

All workflows run on the same high-level AI data pipeline.

## Summary

By bringing AI-powered icon search directly into Slack, designers can now:

- find icons faster
- avoid manually searching across dozens of Figma files
- get reliable answers about icon usage
- stay focused in their existing workflow

For the Icon team, these workflows significantly reduce repetitive support tasks — freeing them to focus on higher-impact design work.
